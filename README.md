Day Planner

## Mission

This page was designed to give the average person on the go an app where they can plan their day. The goal was to experiment with ways utilize local storage, time management and a 3rd party API to build something simple yet dynamic. The intent was not to be overly visual with the app, but to demonstrate useful functionality.

## Technology

JQuery, Font Awesome, Moment.j, googleapis, and bootstrap

### Let's get the day started! Be Productive using [this](https://klangs34.github.io/Day-Planner/) simple day planner!
