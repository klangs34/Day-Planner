Day Planner

## Mission
This page was designed to give the average person on the go an app where they can plan their day.  The goal was to experiment with ways utilize local storage and time management to build something dynamic yet simple.  The intent was not to be overly visual with the app, but to demonstrate useful functionality.

## Technology 
JQuery, Font Awesome, Moment.j and bootstrap
